# Code Breakdown

Here's a breakdown of what we've done in the code:

- We import the necessary libraries (express and jsonwebtoken) and set up an Express server on port 3000.

- We define a secretKey, which should be kept secret in a real application.

- We create a list of dummy user data, including their roles and permissions.

- We define a generateToken function that generates a JWT token for a given user.

- We create a middleware called authenticateAndAuthorize that checks for the presence and validity of a JWT token in the request's Authorization header. It also checks if the user has the required roles or permissions to access specific routes.

- We have two protected routes:

> /user/records: Accessible to any authenticated user.
> /admin/records: Accessible to users with the role "admin" or users with the "write" permission.
> We implement a /login route where users can log in with their credentials, and if valid, they receive a JWT token.

# Testing

Start the server by running node app.js.

Use a tool like Postman or curl to test the API endpoints:

- Login:
    `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "admin123"}' http://localhost:3000/login`

    This should return a JWT token.

- Access User Records:

    `curl -H "Authorization: <your-token>" http://localhost:3000/user/records`
    Replace <your-token> with the token received after login.

- Access Admin Records:
    `curl -H "Authorization: <your-token>" http://localhost:3000/admin/records`

    Replace <your-token> with the token received after login.
